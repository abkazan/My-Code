# This is a group project in which I collaborated with 5 other programmers to build a desktop application of a digital sampler instrument in Python
To run it, download this repository and from the command line, type ``python3 -m digital-sampler``<br>
I can't guarantee that it will work on all Machines so I have included this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGmz3V8Urhc) of me demonstratic some of the basic functionality.
