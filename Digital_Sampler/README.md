This is a group project in which we are bulding a desktop application of a digital sampler instrument in Python
<br>Not all of this code has been written by me. Most of what I contributed can be found in "digitalSampler.py"<br>

In addition to that, this project is still a work in progress, therefore it doesn't fully work yet<br>

I have included the current frontend part of the project, as this is what I have contributed to the most<br>

I plan to talk with my team about uploading the final version of the project in its entirety, once the semester is over<br>

Since it probably won't run, I have included a picture of the frontend
