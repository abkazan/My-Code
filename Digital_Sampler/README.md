This is a group project in which we are bulding a desktop application of a digital sampler instrument in Python.
NOT ALL OF THIS CODE HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY ME
In addition to that, this project is still a work in progress, therefore it doesn't fully work yet.
I have included the current frontend part of the project, as this is what I have contributed the most.
