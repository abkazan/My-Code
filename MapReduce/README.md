This is an implementation of the MapReduce algorithm which returns the count of a specified word in a text file. 

To use it:

1. Download the files
2. Open the terminal
3. Navigate to the folder in the terminal containing the mapreduce files (which will probably be downloads)
5. Create a .txt file in that folder with a series of words (or you can use the example file.txt)
6. In the command line, type "./mapreduce name_of_txt_file word_to_count" and it should return the word count

Note: this might not work on every computer. It was compiled and run on a mac.
