This was a project for data science II at University of Wisconsin-Madison<br>
This project demonstrates oop inheritance, graph search, and web scraping<br>
### Main module: scrape.py 
includes all the search classes, as well as a function that scrapes a basic Flask webpage, and inputs a password to retrieve a hidden image<br>
### Flask app
Was provided by course instructor and can be run with the command "python3 application.py"<br>
### debug.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates the functionality of the scrape module<br>
### tester.py
Tester file was also provided by instructor, and provides thorough testing of the module<br>
### Final note
This was implemented on an instance of a Google Cloud VM, it also required installing various pip packages<br>
Because of this, the code will likely not work on a local machine<br>
