# About this repo
This was a project for data science II at University of Wisconsin-Madison<br>
This project demonstrates oop inheritance, graph search, and web scraping
### Main module: scrape.py 
includes all the search classes, as well as a function that scrapes a basic Flask webpage, and inputs a password to retrieve a hidden image
### Flask app
Skeleton code was provided by course instructor, and implemented/edited by me.<br>
It can be run with the command "python3 application.py"
### debug.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates the functionality of the scrape module
### tester.py
Tester file was also provided by instructor, and provides thorough testing of the module
### Final note
This was implemented on an instance of a Google Cloud VM, it also required installing various pip packages, therefore the code likely will not run on a local machine
