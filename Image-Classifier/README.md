## About this repo
This is a project that utelizes machine learning and the pytorch framework to create a Neural Network that predicts labels on images from the FashionMNIST dataset

## To run:

Download the python file and run it

Note: this project required setting up a python virtual environment in a specific way to work with pytorch. Therefore this might not run on other machines
