This project demonstrates inheritance, graph search, and web scraping<br>
The main module is scrape.py, which includes all the search classes, as well as a function that scrapes a basic Flask webpage, and inputs a password to retrieve a hidden image<br>
The flask app (which was provided) can be run with the command "python3 application.py"<br>
The debug.ipynb file demonstrates the functionality of the scrape module<br>
The file "tester.py" was also provided, and provides thorough testing of the module<br>
Finally, like most of my projects, this was implemented using a Google Cloud VM, therefore it might not work the same<br>
